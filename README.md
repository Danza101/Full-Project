Hello Sir,
Hope your having a great day.
Just wanted to point out my yml file for my assessment is slightly different to the base yml file. I had to make some changes.
Also i wanted to point out there are external files that are required to run this code. You may notice the 'awoc' module inistalled.
Therefore to run it you will need to run on terminal '$ pip install a-world-of-countries'.
Please make sure to read the requirements file for all the imports necessary to download and run the code as i am not 100% sure about which libraries you have installed
